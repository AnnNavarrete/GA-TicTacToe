### Game Creation Process

    First Stage:
    1. created a 3x3 grid for simplicity and closer to original Tic Tac Toe game
    2. created two players and assigned X or 0, using the odd even process to alternative turns
    3. worked on the win algorithm process
        if player win, players can restart a new game
        else it's a draw
    4. assigned a video once the full game is over
